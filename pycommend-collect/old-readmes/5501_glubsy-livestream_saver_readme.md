* Download Youtube livestreams from the very beginning to the end.
* Monitor a given channel for upcoming livestreams and download them automatically when they become active.

Cookies (in Netscape format) are needed to access membership-only videos as well as age-restricted videos (which would also mean that you sold your soul to Youtube and your account is "verified"). You may use [this](https://github.com/hrdl-github/cookies-txt) or [that](https://github.com/dandv/convert-chrome-cookies-to-netscape-format) depending on the browser you used to log into that dis-service.

The example config file `livestream_saver.cfg` is optional and is meant as a convenience to override the default values.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The download feature is currently half-broken (see issue [#63](https://github.com/glubsy/livestream_saver/issues/63)) so we rely on yt-dlp for the time being.
> 
> As a result, many native configuration settings from the config file and CLI arguments (and some hooks) are **ignored**.
> 
> The `ytdlp_config.json` file holds the default options passed to yt-dlp as defined in their [Readme.md](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#embedding-examples). It should be placed in `$HOME/.config/livestream_saver/ytdlp_config.json` and edited, otherwise the default provided template will be used as fallback.
> 
> This is confusing but will be fixed eventually.

> [!CAUTION]
> Youtube is banning IPs that does not pass a [Proof of Origin (PO) token](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors) to their requests. 
> It is advised to generate the token (from the same IP address) and store it in the `ytdlp_config.json` file accordingly so that it get passed to the downloader.


# Monitoring a channel

Monitor a given Youtube channel for any upcoming livestream by requesting the channel's *videos* and *community* tabs every few minutes or so. 
It should automatically download a live stream as soon as one is listed as being active in any of said tabs.

# Merging segments

The *download* sub-command above should automatically merge the downloaded segments once the live stream has ended. If it failed for whatever reason, this sub-command can be invoked on the directory path to the downloaded segments. That directory should be named something like "stream_capture_{VIDEO_ID}".

Basic usage example: `python livestream_saver.py merge /path/to/stream_capture_{VIDEO_ID}` (Windows users should use `py livestream_saver.py`)

```
> python3 livestream_saver.py merge --help

positional arguments:
  PATH                  Path to directory holding vid/aud sub-directories in which segments have been downloaded as well as the metadata.txt file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                        Log level. (Default: INFO)
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        Path to config file to use. (Default: ~/.config/livestream_saver/livestream_saver.cfg)
  -d, --delete-source   Delete source files (vid/aud) once final merging of streams has been successfully done. (default: False)
  -k, --keep-concat     Keep concatenated intermediary files even if merging of streams has been successful. This is only useful for debugging. (default: False)
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Output directory where to write final merged file. (default: None)
```

# Dependencies

* python >= 3.10
* yt-dlp (preferrably always the latest version)
* [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) 10.9.2
* ffmpeg (and ffprobe) to concatenate segments and merge them into one file 
* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) (optional) to convert webp thumbnail

# Installation

* Clone this repository to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/glubsy/livestream_saver.git`

* Setup a virtual environment to install dependencies into and activate the venv:

```
python3 -m venv venv  # or virtualenv -p python3 venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* If you don't want to use a venv (to avoid having to activate the venv everytime you need to start the program, with `source /path/to/venv/bin/activate`), you *could* install dependencies system-wide. Remember to use `sudo pip3` then.

## Docker container

If you prefer to build and use a Docker container, look at the Readme inside the `docker` directory.

Docker image also available at https://hub.docker.com/r/glubsy/livestream_saver (can also be referenced in docker-compose)

# Configuration

The template config file `livestream_saver.cfg` is provided as an example. The default path should be `$HOME/.config/livestream_saver/livestream_saver.cfg` (On Windows, it is read directly from your base user directory).
A lot of options can be overriden via command line arguments. See the --help message for details.

A monitor section for a specific channel can be invoked from the CLI with `--section NAME` where `NAME` is the same string of characters from `[monitor NAME]` in the config file. This helps having one central config file.
If none is specified as argument on the command line, the first section found with this pattern will be loaded. If there is no such section, the variables from the `[monitor]` section will be used as normal.

## Hooks on events

You can spawn a process of your choosing on various events (see config file template). This can be useful to spawn youtube-dl (yt-dlp) in parallel for example.
These hooks can only be specified in a config file. Example:
```ini
# Call this program whenever a download is starting (the live stream might be pending still)
on_download_initiated = yt-dlp --add-metadata --embed-thumbnail --wait-for-video 5 %VIDEO_URL%
```
The following place-holders will be replaced by the corresponding value (more will be added in the future):
- `%VIDEO_URL%`: the URL of the live stream being currently downloaded
- `%COOKIES_PATH%`: the path to the cookie file you have specified (in config, or CLI argument)

Each section (`[monitor]`, `[download]` and `[monitor CHANNEL]`) can have a different value for the same option / event. The `[DEFAULT]` section is only used as a fallback if none of them have an expected value specified. The `[monitor CHANNEL]` section will override any value from the `monitor` section, so you can specify different programs for different channels for example.
The command can be disabled and its output logged with the following options (placed in the **same section** as the affected command). Additionally, regex can be used to narrow own when to spawn a command based on the targeted video's metadata:
```ini
# Disable spawning the command above (same as commenting the command out)
on_download_initiated_command_enabled = false

# Log command's output (both stdout & stderr)
on_download_initiated_command_logged = true

# The command will only spawn if these expressions match against the video title + description:
on_download_initiated_command_allow_regex = ".*archiv.*|.*sing.*"

# The command will not spawn if these expressions match (honestly, this is not that useful, so don't use it): 
on_download_initiated_command_block_regex = ".*pineapple.*|.*banana.*"
```
You can also skip the downloading phase every time with the following option:
```ini
# Skip download phase and only run the subprocess when a stream has started
skip_download = true
```
This is useful if you only want to run yt-dlp (or any other program) when livestream_saver has detected an active broadcast but you don't care about downloading with livestream_saver. This option in particular can be specified in **any** section, even on the command line with argument `--skip-download`.

## Web Hooks

Similar to hook commands above, web hooks can call a specific URL with a POST HTTP request and the corresponding JSON payload.
Therefore, we need two keys for each webhook: `*_webhook` with the POST payload (a JSON), and `*_webhook_url` with the endpoint URL (and secret tokens). 
Then, the same key format applies as for hook commands: `on_upcoming_detected_command` becomes `on_upcoming_detected_webhook`.

For security purposes, any environment variable key starting with `webhook_url` in their name will be placed a virtual `[env]` section, so they can be defererenced by interpolation in other sections in the config file.

Example: `export webhook_url_discord="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/yyy"` then in the config file:
```ini
[common]
webhook_data_upcoming = {SEE TEMPLATE EXAMPLES}
webhook_data_live = {SEE TEMPLATE EXAMPLES}

[webhook]
webhook_url_discord = ${env:webhook_url_discord}

[monitor a_channel]
on_upcoming_detected_webhook = ${webhook:webhook_data_upcoming}
on_upcoming_detected_webhook_url = ${common:webhook_url_discord}

on_download_initiated_webhook = ${webhook:webhook_data_live}
on_download_initiated_webhook_url = ${common:webhook_url_discord}
```

The `webhook_data` keys should be valid JSON enclosed in quotes.
The following placeholders variables will be replaced with the corresponding values (whenever they are available):

```
%TITLE% => title of the video
%AUTHOR% => video author / channel name
%VIDEO_URL% => the URL to the video player page
%DESCRIPTION% => 200 first characters of the video description
%THUMBNAIL_URL% => URL to the best available thumbnail for the video
%VIDEO_ID% => the unique video ID
%START_TIME% => (upcoming videos only) "Scheduled for " + time as GMT+0
%LOCAL_SCHEDULED% => (upcoming videos only) scheduled time as the author's time zone, eg. "December 22, 11:00 AM GMT+9"
%LIVE_STATUS% => (upcoming videos only) eg. "This live event will begin in 3 hours" or "This is a member-only video"
%LIVE_STATUS_SHORT% => (upcoming videos only) shorter version of the above, eg. "Live in 3 hours"
%ISLIVECONTENT% => "Live Stream", or "Video" if it is a VOD
%ISLIVENOW% => "Broadcasting!" if currently live, otherwise "Waiting"
%ISMEMBERSONLY% => "Members only" if only your cookies allowed access
```

## E-mails

The e-mail options can be overriden via environment variables for improved security practices. simply use the same key names (case insensitive). 

Example: ```export SMTP_SERVER="my.smtp.server"; export SMTP_LOGIN="john"; export SMTP_PASSWORD="hunter2"```

Login and password are not mandatory. That depends on your smtp server configuration.

Whenever a crash, or an error occurs, the program should send you a notification at the configured e-mail address via the configured smtp server.


## Testing notifications
You can send a test e-mail and a blank web hook notification with this sub-command: 
```
livestream_saver.py test-notification --log DEBUG
```
Note that only the `webhook_url` and `webhook_data` key/value pairs from the `[webhook]` section will be loaded and tested.


# Known issue

Youtube may log you out if you actively use the session from which you have exported the cookies (in your web browser). See [issue and workarounds here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/8227).

As of 2024/02/15 simply exporting cookies from an "incognito" session seems to reduce the chances of experiencing this issue.


# Notes:

This is beta software. It should work, but in case it doesn't, feel free to report issues. Or better yet, fix them yourself and submit a merge request. Keep in mind that these mega corporations will often attempt to break our things.

# TODO

* Better stream quality selection (webm, by fps, etc.).
* Use other libs (yt-dlp, streamlink) as backends for downloading fragments.
* Add proxy support.
* Fetch segments in parallel to catch up faster (WIP).
* Make sure age-restricted videos are not blocked (we rely on Pytube for this).
* Monitor Twitch channels.
* Make web interface.
