 # Requirements

Written using Python 3.9 so use 3.9 or anything above.

The only two requirements/dependencies should be requests and PyQt5.

There is a "requirements.txt" file that can be used to install the dependencies at the command line: 

<pre><code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>

or 

<pre><code>pip3 install requests</code></pre>
<pre><code>pip3 install pyqt5</code></pre>

The main script is OFDL.py and can be run on some systems by double clicking it (usually Windows) or by going into the directory using terminal or the command line and executing:

<pre><code>python3 OFDL.py</code></pre>
