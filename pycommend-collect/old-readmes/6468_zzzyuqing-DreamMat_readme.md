### Preparation for inference
1. Install packages in `requirements.txt`.
    We test our model on 3090/4090/V100/A6000 with 11.8 CUDA and 2.0.0 pytorch.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/zzzyuqing/DreamMat.git
    cd DreamMat
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Install Blender 

    Download [blender-3.2.2-linux-x64.tar.xz](https://download.blender.org/release/Blender3.2/)
    
    Run:
    ```bash
    tar -xvf blender-3.2.2-linux-x64.tar.xz
    export PATH=$PATH:path_to_blender/blender-3.2.2-linux-x64
    ```


3. Download the pre-trained ControlNet checkpoints [here](https://pan.zju.edu.cn/share/78d6588ec65bcfa432ed22d262) or from [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/zzzyuqing/light-geo-controlnet), and put it to the `threestudio_dreammat/model/controlnet`
4. A docker env can be found at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/zzzyuqing/dreammat_image/general

### Inference

```
cd threestudio_dreammat
sh cmd/run_examples.sh
```

Upon initial execution, each model will undergo pre-rendering using Blender, with an approximate duration of 15 minutes on a 4090 GPU. During this period, there will be no output; thus, patience is requested. For subsequent runs, the `blender_generate` can be set to `false` to bypass this process.
### Geometry- and Light-aware ControlNet
You can also train your own geometry- and light-aware ControlNet. The methods for dataset generation and the training code are presented as follows.

![](assets/pipeline_controlnet.png)
#### Preparation for training
Make sure the environment map folder structure as
```bash
dataset
|-- <env_dir>
    |-- map1
        |-- map1.exr
    |-- map2
        |-- map2.exr
    |-- map3
        |-- map3.exr
    |-- map4
        |-- map4.exr
    |-- map5
        |-- map5.exr
```

Run the following code to generate pre-rendered data for training
```bash
cd controlnet_train
blender -b -P blender_script_geometry.py -- \
    --object_path ./dataset/model/046e3307c74746a58ec4bea5b33b7b97.glb \
    --output_dir ./dataset/training_data \
    --elevation 30 \
    --num_images 16


blender -b -P blender_script_light.py -- \
    --object_path ./dataset/model/046e3307c74746a58ec4bea5b33b7b97.glb \
    --env_dir ./dataset/envmap \
    --output_dir ./dataset/training_data \
    --elevation 30 \
    --num_images 16
```

The dataset folder structure will be as follows
```bash
dataset
|-- training_data
    |-- <uid_0>
        |-- color
            |-- 000_color_env1.png
            |-- ...
        |-- depth
            |-- 000.png
            |-- ...
        |-- light
            |-- 000_m0.0r0.0_env1.png
            |-- ...
        |-- normal
            |-- 000.png
            |-- ...
    |-- <uid_1>
    |-- ...
    
```

#### Training ControlNet

before training, make sure that the json file of prompts is in the format of 
```json
{
    "<uid_0>" : "<prompt_0>",
    "<uid_1>" : "<prompt_1>",
    "<uid_2>" : "<prompt_2>",
    ...
}
```


and the directory of training data is in the structure of
```bash
training_data
|-- <uid_0>
|-- <uid_1>
|-- <uid_2>
|-- ...

```
We provide several data as examples [here](https://pan.zju.edu.cn/share/b1724c30e0b5a3a9861a58570e).

run the training
```bash
cd controlnet_train
accelerate launch diffusers_train_controlnet.py --config config.json 
```
