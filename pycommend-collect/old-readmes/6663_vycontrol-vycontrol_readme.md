VyControl is web frontend interface to manage a single or multiple VyoS servers. It is developed in Python/Django using VyOS API.

# Future Roadmap
VyControl currently is deprecated since VyOS will bring a new API.


# Use Cases:

VyControl can be a web gui for one single VyOS installation, but it requires a separeted webserver from VyOS to a single network admin user or a TI department from a company

VyControl can be a web gui for multiple VyOS installation in a same enterprise, to a single network admin user or a TI department from a company

VyControl can be a web gui for multiple VyOS installation in a datacenter. Each of datacenter customer have a VyControl user to manage their own VyOSes (each user can manage several VyOS).


# Main links
* [VyOS](https://www.vyos.io/) linux firewall website (only compatible with rolling release / 1.3 VyOS)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vycontrol/) 

# Plan to use VyControl?
- [ ] Add new enhancement requests at https://github.com/vycontrol/vycontrol/issues

# Install instructions 

* download [VyOS](https://www.vyos.io/) Rolling Release, since VyControl needs the latest VyOS API.
* configure VyOS-API according VyOS documentation

## Docker
latest VyControl is being autobuilt at dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/r/robertoberto/vycontrol

download latest docker image:
```
docker pull robertoberto/vycontrol
```

run docker:
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 -t robertoberto/vycontrol
```

now you can access http://127.0.0.1:8000


## by docker compose
Right now we are using db.sqlite3, you can edit composer and to change to mySQL/PostgreSQL if needed.

```
find vycontrol | grep migrations | xargs rm -rf
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## manual install instructions

### setup virtual env and pip requirements

virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### create your own configuration
```
cp -a vycontrol/vycontrol/settings_example/ /vycontrol/vycontrol/settings_available/
```
edit according your needs:
* ALLOWED_HOSTS currently 127.0.0.1 is ok for tests
* for tests you don't need to edit EMAIL settings, but forget password will not work
* sqlite is ok for tests, but you can change to MySQL/PostgreSQL. 
* SECRET_KEY edit to anything random, you can use openssl for example:

```
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### setup initial database

cd vycontrol
python3 manage.py makemigrations config --settings=vycontrol.settings_available.production
