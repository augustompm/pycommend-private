## Our Vision

Companies like OpenAI built "Super AI" that threatens human independence. We crave individuality: AI that amplifies, not erases, you.

We‚Äôre challenging that with "**Second Me**": an open-source prototype where you craft your own **AI self**‚Äîa new AI species that preserves you, delivers your context, and defends your interests.

It‚Äôs **locally trained and hosted**‚Äîyour data, your control‚Äîyet **globally connected**, scaling your intelligence across an AI network. Beyond that, it‚Äôs your AI identity interface‚Äîa bold standard linking your AI to the world, sparks collaboration among AI selves, and builds tomorrow‚Äôs truly native AI apps.

Join us. Tech enthusiasts, AI pros, domain experts‚ÄîSecond Me is your launchpad to extend your mind into the digital horizon.

## Key Features

### **Train Your AI Self** with AI-Native Memory ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08102))
Start training your Second Me today with your own memories! Using Hierarchical Memory Modeling (HMM) and the Me-Alignment Algorithm, your AI self captures your identity, understands your context, and reflects you authentically.

## Quick Start




### üçé Option 1: Local Setup (macOS with Apple Silicon)

<!-- > **Special Note: This section is specifically for Mac (Apple Silicon) users** -->

<details open>
<summary><b>Click to expand/collapse Mac setup details</b></summary>

##### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Xcode Command Line Tools

##### Installing Xcode Command Line Tools
If you haven't installed Xcode Command Line Tools yet, you can install them by running:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

After installation, you may need to accept the license agreement:
```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

##### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Mindverse/Second-Me.git
   cd Second-Me
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**

   Choose one of the following options:

   <details>
   <summary><b>Option A: For users with existing conda environment</b></summary>
   
   If you already have conda installed:
   
   1. Create a new environment from our environment file:
      ```bash
      conda env create -f environment.yml   # This will create an environment named 'second-me'
      conda activate second-me
      ```
   
   2. Set the custom conda mode in `.env`:
      ```bash
      CUSTOM_CONDA_MODE=true
      ```
   
   3. Run setup:
      ```bash
      make setup
      ```
   </details>

   <details>
   <summary><b>Option B: For new users</b></summary>
   
   If you're new or want a fresh environment:
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
   
   This command will automatically:
   - Install all required system dependencies (including conda if not present)
   - Create a new Python environment named 'second-me'
   - Build llama.cpp
   - Set up frontend environment
   </details>

3. **Start the service**
   ```bash
   make start
   ```

</details>

### üê≥ Option 2: Docker Setup (For Linux & Windows users)


<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand/collapse Docker setup details</b></summary>

Docker provides a consistent environment across different operating systems.

##### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system

> **Important:** You must install both Docker and Docker Compose before proceeding. If you haven't installed them yet:
> - For Docker installation: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
> - For Docker Compose installation: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

##### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mindverse/Second-Me.git
cd Second-Me
```

2. Build the Docker images
```bash
make docker-build
```

3. Start the containers
```bash
make docker-up
```

4. To stop the containers when you're done
```bash
make docker-down
```

##### Other Useful Docker Commands

- Restart all services
```bash
make docker-restart-all
```

- Rebuild and restart only the backend
```bash
make docker-restart-backend
```

- Rebuild and restart only the frontend
```bash
make docker-restart-frontend
```

</details>

### Accessing the Service

After starting the service (either with local setup or Docker), open your browser and visit:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### View help and more commands
```bash
make help
```

### Important Notes
1. Ensure you have sufficient disk space (at least 10GB recommended)
2. If using local setup with an existing conda environment, ensure there are no conflicting package versions
3. First startup may take a few minutes to download and install dependencies
4. Some commands may require sudo privileges

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check:
1. For local setup: Python and Node.js versions meet requirements
2. For local setup: You're in the correct conda environment
3. All dependencies are properly installed
4. System firewall allows the application to use required ports
5. For Docker setup: Docker daemon is running and you have sufficient permissions
