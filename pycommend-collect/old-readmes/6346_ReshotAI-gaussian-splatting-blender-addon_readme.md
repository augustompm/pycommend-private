## Disclaimer
This add-on was developed mostly as an experimentation, it is slow on large scenes, and not fully accurate. It can be used as a tool to clean floaters in Gaussian Splatting captures.

In order to be faster in non-pointcloud mode, it would be needed to implement gaussians as camera-facing quads, as some implementations for other engines have done.
