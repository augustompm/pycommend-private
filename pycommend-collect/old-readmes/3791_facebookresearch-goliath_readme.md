# Goliath

### Together with [Ava-256](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ava-256), part of Codec Avatar Studio

We provide 4 sets of captures; for each subject:
* 1 relightable head capture
* 1 relightable hands capture
* 1 fully clothed capture
* 1 minimally clothed capture
* 1 mobile head capture
* 1 mobile hands capture
* 1 mobile fully clothed capture
* 1 mobile minimally clothed capture

And code to train personalized decoders:
* [Relightable Gaussian Codec Avatar Heads](https://shunsukesaito.github.io/rgca/) (CVPR'24)
* [Relightable hands](https://sh8.io/#/relightable_hands) (CVPR'23)
* [Universal relightable hands](https://frozenburning.github.io/projects/urhand/) (CVPR'24)
* [Mesh-based bodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10441) (ToG'21)

Please refer to the [samples](https://github.com/facebookresearch/goliath/blob/main/samples/) to get a sense of what the data looks like.

### Disclaimer

This is a pre-release.


### Dependencies

See `requirements.txt`/`environment.yaml`

### Repository structure

- `ca_code/` - python source
    * `loss` - loss functions
    * `models` - standalone models
    * `nn` - reusable modules (layers, blocks, learnable, modules, networks)
    * `utils` - reusable utils (functions, modules w/o learnable params)

- `notebooks/` - example notebooks
- `extensions/` - CUDA extensions
- `data/` - location of sample data and checkpoints


### Data

Besides camera, views, we also provide segmentations, 3d keypoints, registered and unregistered meshes, as well as light information when available.

Access to the dataset is currently gated.
Please email `julietamartinez@meta.com`, preferrably from an institutional email, to get access to the data.


### Compiling and installing extensions

```
cd extensions/{mvpraymarch,sgutils,utils}
make
```

### Training

(You may have to add the directory of the codebase to your `PYTHONPATH`)
```
python ca_code/scripts/run_train.py <config.yml>
```
or simply
```
python -m ca_code.scripts.run_train <config.yml>
```

(URHand training) You may need to unwrap images to get `color_mean.png` for static hand assets before launch training in case there is no `color_mean.png` under `uv_images` for the target identity:
```
python -m ca_code.scripts.run_gen_texmean config/urhand_mesh_example.yml
```

### Visualization (Relighting)

```
python ca_code/scripts/run_vis_relight.py <config.yml>
```

### Evaluation

TODO:
