This repository contains code for the paper [Visual CoT: Advancing Multi-Modal Language Models with a Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16999) and it was built based on [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA)

We collect and introduce the Visual CoT dataset comprising 438k question-answer pairs, annotated with intermediate bounding boxes highlighting key regions essential for answering the questions. The work also proposes a multi-turn processing pipeline for the multi-modal language model that dynamically focuses on visual inputs and provides interpretable thoughts. Importantly, the released benchmark is capable of evaluating MLLMs in scenarios requiring specific local region identification.

> We propose a novel multi-turn processing pipeline for MLLMs that can dynamically focus on visual inputs and provide intermediate interpretable thoughts.

The model weights below are merged weights. You do not need to apply delta. The usage of VisCoT checkpoints should comply with the base LLM's model license.

| Version | Size | Resolution | Checkpoint | 
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| VisCoT | 7B | 224 | [deepcs233/VisCoT-7b-224](https://huggingface.co/deepcs233/VisCoT-7b-224) |
| VisCoT | 7B | 336 | [deepcs233/VisCoT-7b-336](https://huggingface.co/deepcs233/VisCoT-7b-336) |
| VisCoT | 13B | 224 | [deepcs233/VisCoT-13b-224](https://huggingface.co/deepcs233/VisCoT-13b-224) |

## Train

**Our training steps are largely consistent with LLaVA; for further details, please refer to the LLaVA documentation/issues.**

VisCoT training consists of two stages: (1) feature alignment stage: use our 558K subset of the LAION-CC-SBU dataset to connect a *frozen pretrained* vision encoder to a *frozen LLM*; (2) visual instruction tuning stage: use 665K dataset including multimodal instruction-following data and academic VQA tasks from LLaVA-1.5, 1.4M dataset with positional annotations from Shikra, and 373K visual CoT dataset from ours, to teach the model to follow multimodal instructions and obtain the visual CoT ability.

VisCoT is trained on 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB memory. To train on fewer GPUs, you can reduce the `per_device_train_batch_size` and increase the `gradient_accumulation_steps` accordingly. Always keep the global batch size the same: `per_device_train_batch_size` x `gradient_accumulation_steps` x `num_gpus`.

### Hyperparameters
We use a similar set of hyperparameters as Vicuna in finetuning.  Both hyperparameters used in pretraining and finetuning are provided below.

1. Pretraining

| Hyperparameter | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Max length | Weight decay |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| LLaVA-v1.5-13B | 256 | 1e-3 | 1 | 2048 | 0 |

2. Finetuning

| Hyperparameter | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Max length | Weight decay |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| LLaVA-v1.5-13B | 128 | 2e-5 | 1 | 2048 | 0 |

### Download Vicuna checkpoints (automatically)

Our base model Vicuna v1.5, which is an instruction-tuned chatbot, will be downloaded automatically when you run our provided training scripts. No action is needed.

### Pretrain (feature alignment)

In our work, we directly use the project's weight from LLaVA-1.5. If you do not need to train it by yourself, projector weights can be downloaded here: https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md#projector-weights

Please download the 558K subset of the LAION-CC-SBU dataset with BLIP captions used in LLaVA [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Pretrain).

Pretrain takes around 5.5 hours for VisCoT-13B on 8x A100 (80G), due to the increased resolution to 336px. It takes around 3.5 hours for VisCoT-7B.

Training script with DeepSpeed ZeRO-2: [`pretrain.sh`](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/scripts/v1_5/pretrain.sh).

- `--mm_projector_type mlp2x_gelu`: the two-layer MLP vision-language connector.
- `--vision_tower openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336`: CLIP ViT-L/14 336px.

### Visual Instruction Tuning

1. Prepare data

Please download the annotation of our mixed instruction tuning data [viscot_mixed_2m.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepcs233/Visual-CoT/blob/main/viscot_mixed_2m.json) to `./playground/data`. We provide our 363k visual CoT dataset [viscot_363k.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepcs233/Visual-CoT/blob/main/viscot_363k.json) for building your own dataset. Additionally, the `./viscot_dataset` directory contains metadata for the visual CoT dataset, which includes detailed information requiring further postprocessing before it can be used for training. The `./cot_with_detailed_reasoning_steps` directory contains 98k data pairs, each accompanied by detailed reasoning steps. The train/validation split is maintained consistent with the original dataset. Necessary scripts are available in the `./tools` directory. For instance, the script `./tools/convert_data_to_llava_format.py` can convert the meta JSONL file into the required format for training. Please download the images for constituting datasets, and some of them may need to register/complete the form first.

We also prepare the image file in this [link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepcs233/Visual-CoT/tree/main/cot_with_detailed_reasoning_steps), you need to merge these split archive files and then extract them.

2. Start training!

We have prepared [LLaVA's pretrained projectors](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md) in our repo (checkpoints/llava_7b_mm_projector.bin and checkpoints/llava_13b_mm_projector.bin). It is not recommended to use legacy projectors, as they may be trained with a different version of the codebase, and if any option is off, the model will not function/train as we expected.

Visual instruction tuning takes around 60 hours for VisCoT-7b-224 on 8x A100 (80G).

Training script with DeepSpeed ZeRO-3: [`finetune.sh`](https://github.com/deepcs233/Visual-CoT/blob/main/scripts/v1_5/finetune.sh).

If you are interested in finetuning LLaVA model to your own task/data, please check out [`Finetune_Custom_Data.md`](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Finetune_Custom_Data.md)ã€‚

Some options to note:

- `--mm_projector_type mlp2x_gelu`: the two-layer MLP vision-language connector.
- `--vision_tower openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336`: CLIP ViT-L/14 336px.
- `--ft_vision_tower True`: finetune the vision encoder with the same learning rate as the backbone.
- `--vision_tower_lr 2e-6`: use a specific vision encder learning rate.
