### Examples

```
"~/" represents home folder on Linux/Mac. If you use Windows, don't use it.
If you put your files into project directory, you can just specify the file name,
otherwise you should give the full path.
```

* Search for "wireless keyboard" with the default 4 seconds visit time on clicked ad pages.

    * `python ad_clicker.py -q "wireless keyboard"`

* Search for "wireless keyboard" with maximum scroll set to 5.

    * `python ad_clicker.py -q "wireless keyboard" -l 5`

    * By default(0), it will scroll until the end.

* Search for "wireless keyboard" using headless browser.

    * `python ad_clicker.py -q "wireless keyboard" --headless`

* Search for "wireless keyboard" using the given proxy without authentication.

    * `python ad_clicker.py -q "wireless keyboard" -p host:port`

* Search for "wireless keyboard" using the given proxy with authentication.

    * `python ad_clicker.py -q "wireless keyboard" --auth -p username:password@host:port`

* Search for "wireless keyboard" using a proxy from the given file.

    * `python ad_clicker.py -q "wireless keyboard" -pf ~/proxies.txt`

* Search for "wireless speaker" and click links that include the given filter words in url or title.

    * `python ad_clicker.py -q "wireless speaker@amazon#ebay  # mediamarkt"`

    * Spaces around "@" and "#" are ignored, so both "wireless speaker@amazon#ebay" and
    "wireless speaker @ amazon  # ebay" take "wireless speaker" as search query and "amazon" and "ebay"
    as filter words.

    * If you will give a target domain as filter word, don't use "http" or "www" parts in it. Use like "query@domainname.com" or even "query@domainname". Keep it as short as possible to get a match.

* Search for "wireless speaker" and click links except the ones containing the given words in url or title.

    * `python ad_clicker.py -q "wireless speaker" -e "amazon.com,mediamarkt.com,for 2022,Soundbar"`

    * Separate multiple exclude items with comma.

* Run browser in `incognito` mode.

    * `python ad_clicker.py -q "wireless speaker" --incognito`

    * Note that the proxy extension is not enabled in *incognito* mode.

* Run multiple browsers by taking queries and proxies with authentication from the given files.

    * `python run_ad_clicker.py -qf ~/queries.txt --auth -pf ~/proxies.txt`

    * You can see example queries in `sample_queries.txt` file.

* Run multiple browsers by taking queries and proxies with authentication from the given files and pass exclude words.

    * `python run_ad_clicker.py -qf ~/queries.txt --auth -pf ~/proxies.txt -e "amazon.com,mediamarkt.com,for 2022"`

* Run multiple browsers by taking queries and proxies without authentication from the given files with 5 browsers.

    * `python run_ad_clicker.py -qf ~/queries.txt -pf ~/proxies.txt -bc 5`

    * If -bc(--browser_count) option is not given, the number of cpu cores is used.

* Run multiple browsers by taking queries and proxies from the given files using alternative multiprocess style.

    * `python run_ad_clicker.py -qf ~/queries.txt -pf ~/proxies.txt -ms 2`

    * **1**: each browser instance gets a different query from file (default) (e.g. 5 browsers search the first 5 queries from the file.
        After they are completed, second group of 5 browsers search the next 5 queries from the file and so on)
    * **2**: multiple browser instances get the same query (e.g. 5 browsers search the first query from file. After
        they are completed, second group of 5 browsers search the second query and so on)

    * If the number of queries or proxies are less than the number of browsers to run, they are cycled.

![Multiprocess Run](assets/ad_clicker_multiprocess.gif)

* Run the tool in loop.

    * `python run_in_loop.py -qf ~/queries.txt -pf ~/proxies.txt --auth`

    * Query and proxy files are required for this command.
    * Default wait time between runs is 60 seconds.

* Run the tool in loop with given number of browser instances.

    * `python run_in_loop.py -qf ~/queries.txt -pf ~/proxies.txt --auth -bc 4`

* Run the tool in loop with given number of browser instances and maximum scroll set to 10.

    * `python run_in_loop.py -qf ~/queries.txt -pf ~/proxies.txt --auth -bc 4 -l 10`

* Run the tool in loop with given number of browser instances and 2 minutes wait between runs.

    * `python run_in_loop.py -qf ~/queries.txt -pf ~/proxies.txt --auth -bc 2 -wt 120`

    * Wait time parameter should be in seconds.

* Run the tool in loop with given number of browser instances and pass exclude words.

    * `python run_in_loop.py -qf ~/queries.txt -pf ~/proxies.txt --auth -bc 2 -e "amazon.com,mediamarkt.com,for 2022"`

* Run the tool in loop using alternative multiprocess style.

    * `python run_in_loop.py -qf ~/queries.txt -pf ~/proxies.txt --auth -ms 2`

### How to run Docker image on Linux

* If you want to use the prebuilt image from DockerHub, you can use the following command.
    * `docker pull codenineeight/ad_clicker_docker`

* Run the following command on your host machine once.
    * `xhost local:docker`

* Create a volume for the input files
    * `docker volume create ad_clicker_files`

* Add your queries and proxies files to the created volume
    * `docker run -v ad_clicker_files:/data -v <queries.txt folder path>:/mnt/host alpine cp /mnt/host/queries.txt /data/`
    * `docker run -v ad_clicker_files:/data -v <proxies.txt folder path>:/mnt/host alpine cp /mnt/host/proxies.txt /data/`

    * Check if the files are copied successfully

        `docker run --rm -v ad_clicker_files:/data alpine ls -l /data`

        ```sh
        -rw-r--r--    1 root     root           165 Apr  1 09:25 proxies.txt
        -rw-r--r--    1 root     root           216 Apr  1 09:25 queries.txt
        ```

* You can pass the arguments as before after the image name(in this case codenineeight/ad_clicker_docker)

    * `docker run --rm -it --net=host -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v ad_clicker_files:/data codenineeight/ad_clicker_docker run_ad_clicker.py -qf /data/queries.txt --auth -pf /data/proxies.txt -bc 2`

    * `docker run --rm -it --net=host -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY codenineeight/ad_clicker_docker ad_clicker.py -q "wireless keyboard" -p username:password@host:port --auth`
