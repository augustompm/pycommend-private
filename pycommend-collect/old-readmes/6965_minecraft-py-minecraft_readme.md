# Minecraftpy
A minecraft-like game written in python, in the early stage of development.

## Play It
Typing the following lines of commands to play the game:
```bash
# Create a venv environment is a good choice!
python -m venv .
source bin/activate
# Then run the game.
./bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m minecraft --player <name>:<uuid>
```

<!-- Notice that `name` and `uuid` should always be provided when start the game. -->

## Short-term Goal
