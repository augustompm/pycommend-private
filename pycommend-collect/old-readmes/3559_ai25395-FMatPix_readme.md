# How to use the code?
1.Setup your python env according to the requirements.txt <br>
2.Create a folder named "models", download and unzip models_texify.zip to the folder "models" from release page v1.7<br>
3.Create a folder named "texmml", download and unzip texmml.zip to the folder "texmml" from release page v1.2<br>
4.Just run the ocr_gui.py <br>
I've tried my best to simplify the code and preject,so it's easy to modify the GUI and intergrate other OCR model to this. <br>

# Potential issues
1、It will consume much time if you snip a very large image.<br>
2、Some format errors in MathML because it's tranformed from latex.I've tried to solve most of them.I suggest copying latex to mathtype directly<br>
3、Sometimes, there can be formatting issues with curly braces.<br>
4、Some letters or symbols cannot be recognized because not or rarely in the token vocabulary or training set.<br>
5、If you paste a very long formula to mathtype, it will report a error.So please avoid that.<br><br>
If you find any other issues，contact me.I'll keep updating this if necessary.

# Fequently Asked Questions
1、Support for Mac<br>
I'm trying to find a Mac to develop and test first but there is even no a Mac I can borrow.So I'll try a cloud Mac then.<br>
2、Self-defined Shortcut for Snipping<br>
I have set Alt+Q in the v1.4 for snipping which will satify most people.And probably I wont't add a self-define function,
because it'll introduce a config file which will make FMatPix.exe -> FMatPix.exe + xxx.xml. I mean there'll be an additional file.<br>
Forgive my OCD please.<br>
3、Support for double monitors<br>
From v1.5,FMatPix has started supporting double monitors.<br>
