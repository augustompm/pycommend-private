# StoryToolkitAI

## Description

**StoryToolkitAI is a film editing tool that tries to understand your footage and helps you edit more efficiently with the assistance of AI.**

It transcribes, indexes scenes, helps you search through your footage, automatically selects and creates stories using large language models (OpenAI GPT-4, llama, DeepSeek etc.),
which you can then import into your editing software via EDL or XML.

The tool works locally on your machine, independent of any other editing software, but it also integrates with DaVinci Resolve Studio 18+.

# Download, Setup & Installation

To download the latest standalone release, see [the releases page](https://github.com/octimot/StoryToolkitAI/releases).

However, the standalone releases will most likely always be behind the git version, 
so, if you're comfortable with the terminal / command line and want to always have access to the newest features, 
we recommend that you try to install the tool from source.

For detailed installation instructions
[go here](https://github.com/octimot/StoryToolkitAI/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md).

## Is it really free?
Yes, the tool runs locally and there's no need for any additional account to transcribe, index video or search.
These features will always be free as long as your machine supports them without external services. 

The only feature that now requires external services is the Assistant when you want to use on external LLM providers (OpenAI etc.).
However, you can run local LLMs too!

We rely on the support of our [Patreon members](https://www.patreon.com/StoryToolkitAI)!

## About data privacy
By the way, if you feel that your content is sensitive or subject to privacy laws, no worries: 
the tool does not send anything that you don't want to the Internet, it only uses your local machine to transcribe and 
translate your audio.

Currently, the only features that send data from your machine to the Internet are:
- The StoryToolkitAI API Key check to storytoolkit.ai (only when entered in the Settings Window)
- The Assistant, to OpenAI, storytoolkit.ai or other external providers (only contexts and messages that you select and send).

The tool also checks for updates on every start.

# Code
This tool is coded by Octavian Mot, your unfriendly filmmaker who hates to code and tries to keep it together as
[half of mots](https://mots.us). Our team uses it daily in our editing room which allows us to update it with
features that we need and think will be useful to others.

But, keep in mind that the tool is still being actively developed, raw and unpolished.

Feel free to get in touch with criticism, or weird ideas for new features. 

The tool would be useless without using the following open source projects:
- [OpenAI Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/)
- [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/)
- [pyannote.audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/)
- [speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain)
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)
- [CustomTkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/)
- and many other packages listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/octimot/StoryToolkitAI/blob/main/requirements.txt)

## Code contributions are welcome!

Please open an issue with what you're trying to solve first and let's discuss it there.
