# BlobHunter

An opensource tool for scanning Azure blob storage accounts for publicly opened blobs.  
BlobHunter is a part of [Hunting Azure Blobs Exposes Millions of Sensitive Files](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/hunting-azure-blobs-exposes-millions-of-sensitive-files) research.  
  
## Overview

BlobHunter helps you identify Azure blob storage containers which store files that are publicly available to anyone with an internet connection.  
The tool will help mitigate risk by identifying poorly configured containers that store sensitive data, which is specifically helpful in larger scale Azure subscriptions where there are a significant number of storage accounts that could be hard to track.  
BlobHunter produces an informative csv result file that provides important details on each publicly opened container in the scanned environment.

## Requirements

1. Python 3.5+

2. Azure CLI

3. [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) packages

4. Azure user with one of the following [built-in roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles):

   -	[Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner)  
   -  [Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor)  
   -	[Storage Account Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor)  

   Or any Azure user with a role that allows to perform the following Azure actions:

   ```
   Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/read
   Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read
   Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read
   Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action
   Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/read
   Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read
   ```

## Build

#### Example for installation on Ubuntu:

```bash
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are not logged in in the Azure CLI, a browser window will be prompted at you for inserting your Azure user credentials.
