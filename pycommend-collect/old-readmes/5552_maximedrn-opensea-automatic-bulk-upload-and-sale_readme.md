<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>With this bot, <strong>you can choose to upload, list or even both your non-fungible tokens</strong> on the OpenSea marketplace.</p>

<p>You just have to <strong><a href="https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/wiki/Creation-of-the-metadata-file">create or convert a metadata file</a></strong> following the requested structure, JSON, CSV and XLSX (Excel file) formats are available. This file will include every detail for each NFT. Then, you just have to <strong><a href="https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/wiki/Installation-and-configuration">launch the bot</a></strong> and <strong>select the action you want to perform</strong>, as well as the metadata file created. Finally, <strong>the bot will automate the tedious task of uploading or listing NFTs, one by one by hand, for several days</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Absolutely <strong>all upload details are supported</strong>, you can add as many properties as you want.</li>
<li><strong>All file formats</strong> offered by OpenSea <strong>are compatible</strong>, including images, videos or even 3D models.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum and Polygon blockchains are supported</strong>, and the switch between these two blockchains is also supported.</li>
<li>In case of failure during an upload, a listing or when you only want to upload your NFTs on OpenSea, <strong>a file is generated with details already filled</strong> in or to be filled in.</li>
</ul>
