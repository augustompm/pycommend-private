# Learn Wagtail (from scratch)

The original Learn Wagtail course can be found at [https://learnwagtail.com/tutorials/](https://learnwagtail.com/tutorials/) or at [https://wagtail.io/course/](https://wagtail.io/course/) (same videos). This course is the original Learn Wagtail series and all these videos are entirely free and available on the website _and_ on YouTube.

### Learn Wagtail Course
The Learn Wagtail course is a free beginner-friendly course that dives into several of Wagtail fundamentals. It's not particularily guided for a course, but it does dive into _a lot_ of different Wagtail subjects.

The entire Learn Wagtail course, and additional materials, can be found at [https://learnwagtail.com/tutorials/](https://learnwagtail.com/tutorials/).

### Wagtail for Beginners Course
There is a second Wagtail course called Wagtail for Beginners which is available at [https://learnwagtail.com/wagtail-for-beginners/](https://learnwagtail.com/wagtail-for-beginners/).

**This is not the same as the Learn Wagtail course**.

Wagtail for Beginners is a premium course that takes you from A-Z and includes everything from setting up a new Wagtail website to launching it on Digital Ocean.

### YouTube Playlist
All the videos are hosted on YouTube as well [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMQHMcNi6ocsS8Bfnuy_IDgJ4bHRRrvub](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMQHMcNi6ocsS8Bfnuy_IDgJ4bHRRrvub). There's currently over 55 videos to digest. And once again, all the code you see in the videos can be referrenced in this GitHub repository.

### Documentation
Most of the videos have some form of written tutorial that you can find on the learnwagtail.com website. But please keep in mind that learnwagtail.com is not trying to re-write the [Wagtail Documentation](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/), it's merely an additional support line. For more clear documentation about feature-specific details, you are always urged to read the Wagtail Docs or [join us on Slack](https://wagtail.io/slack)
