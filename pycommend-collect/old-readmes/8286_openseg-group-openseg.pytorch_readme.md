We provide a set of baseline results and trained models available for download in the [Model Zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md).

## Introduction

This is the official code of [OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04514.pdf), [OCNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00916.pdf), [ISA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12273.pdf) and [SegFix](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04269.pdf). OCR, OCNet, and ISA focus on better context aggregation mechanisms (in the semantic segmentation task) and ISA focuses on addressing the boundary errors (in both semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks). We highlight the overall framework of OCR and SegFix in the figures as shown below:

  pink dashed box. (ii) estimate the object region representations in the purple dashed box.
  (iii) compute the object contextual representations and the augmented representations
  in the orange dashed box.

  <figcaption>Fig.2 - Illustrating the SegFix framework: In the training stage, we first send
  the input image into a backbone to predict a feature map. Then we apply a boundary
  branch to predict a binary boundary map and a direction branch to predict a direction
  map and mask it with the binary boundary map. We apply boundary loss and direction
  loss on the predicted boundary map and direction map separately. In the testing stage,
  we first convert the direction map to offset map and then refine the segmentation
  results of any existing methods according to the offset map.
