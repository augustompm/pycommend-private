Quickly extract text from almost any source: youtube, screencasts, PDFs, webpages, photos, etc.
Grab the image and get the text.

The Frog could help you to deal with QR codes helping you to get them decoded!

## :tada: Support
If you like Frog and you want to support its development, you can buy me a coffee:

## Building

I'm the guy who loves GUI tools instead of command-line thus I recommend using [Builder](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder) to develop applications.
To build the frog application just open project folder in Builder and press "Execute" (F5). It will download requirements and build the app.


## Localization

If you want to provide localization for your language you may use [weblate project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/frog/default/) or [Poedit](https://poedit.net) to create translations. Source files listed in `po/POTFILES`.

## Code of conduct

Frog follows the GNOME project [Code of Conduct](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/amberol/-/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md). All
communications in project spaces are expected to follow it.
