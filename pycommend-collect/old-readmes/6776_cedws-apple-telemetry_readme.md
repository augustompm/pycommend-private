Domain blocklists, IP blocklists, and cloaking files for domains that Apple devices frequently contact. DNSCloak is an excellent app capable of using these files, but it's a bit of a pain to get the blocklists onto your device. **Services such as updates, App Store, and Apple Pay will probably be blocked by this list.** You can remove entries manually, but this is tedious, so I recommend just temporarily disabling the blocklist when necessary.

Here's a vague [overview of what each domain is for](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210060).

## Why?

Users should have more control over the telemetry sent by their smartphones. Not only that, but I've seen a large improvement to my device's battery life while using these blocklists.

## Usage (iOS)

- Download DNSCloak, or another app capable of using DNS blocklists
- Navigate to [releases](https://github.com/cedws/apple-telemetry/releases)
- Copy the desired blocklist to your clipboard (`cloaking-rules` is recommended)
- Download Textor, or another app capable of saving text to Files
- In Textor, create a new file and paste the blocklist
- Remove domains for services you wish to use (such as Apple Pay)
- Navigate to the DNSCloak settings and select the saved blocklist

## Usage (macOS)

- Add desired hosts to block to `/etc/hosts`

## Notes

* This is not an exhaustive list. There are hundreds of domains contacted on a regular basis by Apple devices, with no consistent naming scheme or obvious purpose. If you want to block all domains, you should use a whitelist.

* Some domains may not be related to Apple. I've had to filter out the domains from my own blacklist log manually. However, some domains such as `weather.com` are contacted by built-in applications (Weather). Entries like these belong in this repository.

## Contribution

If you come across any other domains, please submit a PR! Add the entries to the `blacklist` file then run `make` (you'll also need Python 3 - use the Poetry package manager). It can take a few minutes because it has to make a lot of DNS queries.
