# Carseat - A Junior Seatbelt

## Description
Carseat is a python implementation of [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt/). This tool contains all (all minus one technically) modules in Seatbelt that support remote execution as an option. Just like Seatbelt you likely will need privileged access to the target host you are running any modules against.

### installation
The only non-standard python libraries used are impacket and pefile. So you can install them individually or through the requirements file. 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Useage
To run a single command

```
python CarSeat.py domain/user:password@10.10.10.10 AntiVirus
```

To run multiple at once

```
python CarSeat.py domain/user:password@10.10.10.10 AntiVirus,UAC,ScheduledTasks
```

To run grouped commands
```
python CarSeat.py -group remote domain/user:password@10.10.10.10 InterestingProcesses
```

To run command with arguments
```
python CarSeat.py -group remote domain/user:password@10.10.10.10 ExplicitLogonEvents 10
```

Like other impacket tools CarSeat accepts passwords, hashes or kerberos tickets for authentication.

```
python CarSeat.py -hashes :8846F7EAEE8FB117AD06BDD830B7586C -no-pass domain/user:@10.10.10.10 WSUS
```
or
```
export KRB5CCNAME=admin_tgt.ccache
python CarSeat.py -k -no-pass domain/user:@10.10.10.10 WindowsFirewall
```

Groups are the same as Seatbelt's. Only difference is `-group remote` will run all modules since they are all considered remote.
