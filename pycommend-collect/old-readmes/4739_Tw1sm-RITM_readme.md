# RITM
This is a Python implementation of the man-in-the-middle attack described by Charlie Clark ([@exploitph](https://twitter.com/exploitph)) in his post, [New Attack Paths? AS Requested Service Tickets](https://www.semperis.com/blog/new-attack-paths-as-requested-sts/), and demonstrated in his proof-of-concept, [Roast in the Middle](https://github.com/0xe7/RoastInTheMiddle).

In short, this tool:
1. Performs ARP spoofing between your target(s) and the gateway to obtain a man-in-the-middle position
2. Sniffs traffic for an AS-REQ containing `PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP` data (yes, this will miss a valid AS-REQ where pre-auth is not required)
3. Replays the sniffed AS-REQ to a DC after changing the SPN to usernames/SPNs provided via a file
4. Outputs any roasted account hashes

[Post about RITM](https://tw1sm.substack.com/p/roast-in-the-middle). For a greater level of technical detail I recommend reading Charlie's blog.

_WARNING: Attempting to man-in-the-middle too many targets may cause latency issues for the victim's machines. RITM has only been tested on <5 targets at a time. Specifying network equipment as targets with `-t/--targets` and subsequently ARP spoofing against them will likely have a negative effect on the network._

RITM will restore the ARP caches of target machines upon completion or `Ctrl-C`. If an uncaught error is thrown and RITM errors out, you can restart RITM and quickly `Ctrl-C` to restore ARP caches.

## Install
RITM can be installed by cloning this repository and running `pip3 install .` and subsequently executed from PATH with either `ritm` or `roastinthemiddle`

## Usage

## Example
![](.github/example.png)

- I highly recommend specifying a domain controller to roast with `--dc-ip`
- If target(s) and DC are on same subnet, set the DC's IP with `--gateway`/`-g`

## Development
RITM uses Poetry to manage dependencies. Install from source and setup for development with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tw1sm/ritm
cd ritm
poetry install
poetry run ritm --help
```
