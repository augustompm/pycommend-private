# Learning Python Basics with the Real World Examples
This repository is meant to teach Python fundamentals with real-world examples.
It would invoke some thoughts and logic inside you to go further.

There are also lots of examples and exercises that you can do to become comfortable with Python Programming.
Once you are comfortable with the basic concepts explained in this repository, you can practice the exercises mentioned in the exercise folder.
Real-world examples are the examples you see around you on a regular basis, such as converting JSON to CSV, PDF to images, web scraping, etc.


## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x preferably > 3.7
2. Mostly pip would be installed with Python package, if not then install pip separately.
3. git is installed, and you know the basics of git commands.
4. Have access to the terminal/command line
5. You know basic concepts of any programming language, it not mandatory, though

## Troubleshoot
- You should be using Python 3.x, preferably > 3.9
- Check python version `python --version`
- Similarly, check pip version `pip --version`. It should point to Python3.x
- If you get the module name not found error, try to install that named module as `pip install module-name`
- If you are getting any other error, mail me. I would add those steps here.
- for tkinter to work in macOS, you need to run `brew install python-tk`
- If speech recognition is not working, try `pip3 install SpeechRecognition` and `pip3 install pyaudio`
- distutils module stopped working in python3.12
