> [!NOTE]
> Current evaluation techniques are often inadequate for advanced **agentic systems** due to their focus on final outcomes and labor-intensive manual reviews. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the **Agent-as-a-Judge** framework. 
>

## ðŸ¤  Features

Agent-as-a-Judge offers two key advantages:

- **Automated Evaluation**: Agent-as-a-Judge can evaluate tasks during or after execution, saving 97.72% of time and 97.64% of costs compared to human experts.
- **Provide Reward Signals**: It provides continuous, step-by-step feedback that can be used as reward signals for further agentic training and improvement.

## ðŸŽ® Quick Start 

### 1. install

```python
git clone https://github.com/metauto-ai/agent-as-a-judge.git
cd agent-as-a-judge/
conda create -n aaaj python=3.11
conda activate aaaj
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

### 2. set LLM&API

Before running, rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the **required APIs and Settings** in the main repo folder to support LLM calling. The `LiteLLM` tool supports various LLMs.

### 3. run 

> [!TIP]
> See more comprehensive [usage scripts](scripts/README.md).
>


#### Usage A: **Ask Anything** for Any Workspace:

```python 

PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/run_ask.py \
  --workspace $(pwd)/benchmark/workspaces/OpenHands/39_Drug_Response_Prediction_SVM_GDSC_ML \
  --question "What does this workspace contain?"
```

You can find an [example](assets/ask_sample.md) to see how **Ask Anything** works.


#### Usage B: **Agent-as-a-Judge** for **DevAI**


```python

PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/run_aaaj.py \
  --developer_agent "OpenHands" \
  --setting "black_box" \
  --planning "efficient (no planning)" \
  --benchmark_dir $(pwd)/benchmark
```

ðŸ’¡ There is an [example](assets/aaaj_sample.md) that shows the process of how **Agent-as-a-Judge** collects evidence for judging.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As a **proof-of-concept**, we applied **Agent-as-a-Judge** to code generation tasks using **DevAI**, a benchmark consisting of 55 realistic AI development tasks with 365 hierarchical user requirements. The results demonstrate that **Agent-as-a-Judge** significantly outperforms traditional evaluation methods, delivering reliable reward signals for scalable self-improvement in agentic systems.
