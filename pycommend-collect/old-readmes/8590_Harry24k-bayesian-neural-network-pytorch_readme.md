This is a lightweight repository of bayesian neural network for PyTorch.

## Usage

### :clipboard: Dependencies

- torch 1.2.0
- python 3.6



### :hammer: Installation

- `pip install torchbnn` or
- `git clone https://github.com/Harry24k/bayesian-neural-network-pytorch`

```python
import torchbnn
```



### :rocket: Demos

* **Bayesian Neural Network Regression** ([code](https://github.com/Harry24k/bayesian-neural-network-pytorch/blob/master/demos/Bayesian%20Neural%20Network%20Regression.ipynb)): 
In this demo, two-layer bayesian neural network is constructed and trained on simple custom data. It shows how bayesian-neural-network works and randomness of the model.
* **Bayesian Neural Network Classification** ([code](https://github.com/Harry24k/bayesian-neural-network-pytorch/blob/master/demos/Bayesian%20Neural%20Network%20Classification.ipynb)): 
To classify Iris data, in this demo, two-layer bayesian neural network is constructed and trained on the Iris data. It shows how bayesian-neural-network works and randomness of the model.
* **Convert to Bayesian Neural Network** ([code](https://github.com/Harry24k/bayesian-neural-network-pytorch/blob/master/demos/Convert%20to%20Bayesian%20Neural%20Network.ipynb)): 
To convert a basic neural network to a bayesian neural network, this demo shows how `nonbayes_to_bayes` and `bayes_to_nonbayes` work.
* **Freeze Bayesian Neural Network** ([code](https://github.com/Harry24k/bayesian-neural-network-pytorch/blob/master/demos/Freeze%20Bayesian%20Neural%20Network.ipynb)): 
To freeze a bayesian neural network, which means force a bayesian neural network to output same result for same input, this demo shows the effect of `freeze` and `unfreeze`.
