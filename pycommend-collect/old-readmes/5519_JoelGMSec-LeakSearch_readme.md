# LeakSearch
**LeakSearch** is a simple tool to search and parse plain text passwords using ProxyNova COMB (Combination Of Many Breaches) over the Internet. You can define a custom proxy and you can also use your own password file, to search using different keywords: such as user, domain or password. 

In addition, you can define how many results you want to display on the terminal and export them as JSON or TXT files. Due to the simplicity of the code, it is very easy to add new sources, so more providers will be added in the future.
