# IMPORTANT (PLEASE READ)

## (2024-05-17) THE END ... For now...
After what seems to be some minor change in the NHL API, new issues arose which rendered the software unusable. I have been working on a new version built from the ground up and decided to put my focus on it instead of fixing and supporting this one. I therefore decided to Archive this repository. The plan is to roll out the new version in the fall, in time for the 2024-2025 NHL season. 

## Shout-out

First, these two for making this repo top notch and already working on future versions:

- [Josh Kay](https://github.com/joshkay)

- [Sean Ostermann](https://github.com/falkyre)

This project was inspired by the [mlb-led-scoreboard](https://github.com/MLB-LED-Scoreboard/mlb-led-scoreboard). Go check it out and try it on your board, even if you are not a baseball fan, it's amazing.

I also used this [nhlscoreboard repo](https://github.com/quarterturn/nhlscoreboard) as a guide at the very beginning as I was learning python.
You all can thank [Drew Hynes](https://gitlab.com/dword4) for his hard work on documenting the free [nhl api](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi).
