# News <span style="color: red;">‚ùó</span> 
[2024.12] In the spring of next year, we will build a new agent system based on LLMs and small models optimized for IE tasks. The system will be more powerful and general than the models in OmniEvent. The OmniEvent repository will only serve as introductory code for EE, and major updates will no longer be made in the future.

[2024.10] We recently released a series of LLMs (**[ADELIE](https://huggingface.co/THU-KEG/ADELIE-SFT-1.5B)**) trained for information extraction, which includes event extraction tasks. Although its performance underperforms specialized small models, such as BERT, its general capabilities and ability to learn from schemas in context are impressive. Welcome to try! Link: https://huggingface.co/THU-KEG/ADELIE-SFT-1.5B. 



# Overview
OmniEvent is a powerful open-source toolkit for **event extraction**, including **event detection** and **event argument extraction**. We comprehensively cover various paradigms and provide fair and unified evaluations on widely-used **English** and **Chinese** datasets. Modular implementations make OmniEvent highly extensible.

## Highlights
- **Comprehensive Capability**
  - Support to do ***Event Extraction*** at once, and also to independently do its two subtasks: ***Event Detection***, ***Event Argument Extraction***.
  - Cover various paradigms: ***Token Classification***, ***Sequence Labeling***, ***MRC(QA)*** and ***Seq2Seq***.
  - Implement ***Transformer-based*** ([BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf), [T5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf), etc.) and ***classical*** ([DMCNN](https://aclanthology.org/P15-1017.pdf), [CRF](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/Web/People/aladdin/papers/pdfs/y2001/crf.pdf), etc.) models.
  - Both ***Chinese*** and ***English*** are supported for all event extraction sub-tasks, paradigms and models. 

- **Unified Benchmark & Evaluation** 
  - Various datasets are processed into a [unified format](https://github.com/THU-KEG/OmniEvent/tree/main/scripts/data_processing#unified-omnievent-format).
  - Predictions of different paradigms are all converted into a [unified candidate set](https://github.com/THU-KEG/OmniEvent/tree/main/OmniEvent/evaluation#convert-the-predictions-of-different-paradigms-to-a-unified-candidate-set) for fair evaluations.
  - Four [evaluation modes](https://github.com/THU-KEG/OmniEvent/tree/main/OmniEvent/evaluation#provide-four-standard-eae-evaluation-modes) (**gold**, **loose**, **default**, **strict**) well cover different previous evaluation settings.

- **Modular Implementation**
  - All models are decomposed into four modules:
    - **Input Engineering**: Prepare inputs and support various input engineering methods like prompting.
    - **Backbone**: Encode text into hidden states.
    - **Aggregation**: Fuse hidden states (e.g., select [CLS], pooling, GCN) to the final event representation. 
    - **Output Head**: Map the event representation to the final outputs, such as Linear, CRF, MRC head, etc. 
  - You can combine and reimplement different modules to design and implement your own new model.

- **Big Model Training & Inference**
  - Efficient training and inference of big event extraction models are supported with [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain).

- **Easy to Use & Highly Extensible**
  - Open datasets can be downloaded and processed with a single command.
  - Fully compatible with ü§ó [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and its [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer).
  - Users can easily reproduce existing models and build customized models with OmniEvent.

# Easy Start
OmniEvent provides several off-the-shelf models for the users. Examples are shown below.

*Make sure you have installed OmniEvent as instructed above. Note that it may take a few minutes to download checkpoint at the first time.*
```python
>>> from OmniEvent.infer import infer

>>> # Even Extraction (EE) Task
>>> text = "2022Âπ¥Âåó‰∫¨Â∏Ç‰∏æÂäû‰∫ÜÂÜ¨Â••‰ºö"
>>> results = infer(text=text, task="EE")
>>> print(results[0]["events"])
[
    {
        "type": "ÁªÑÁªáË°å‰∏∫ÂºÄÂπï", "trigger": "‰∏æÂäû", "offset": [8, 10],
        "arguments": [
            {   "mention": "2022Âπ¥", "offset": [9, 16], "role": "Êó∂Èó¥"},
            {   "mention": "Âåó‰∫¨Â∏Ç", "offset": [81, 89], "role": "Âú∞ÁÇπ"},
            {   "mention": "ÂÜ¨Â••‰ºö", "offset": [0, 4], "role": "Ê¥ªÂä®ÂêçÁß∞"},
        ]
    }
]

>>> text = "U.S. and British troops were moving on the strategic southern port city of Basra \ 
Saturday after a massive aerial assault pounded Baghdad at dawn"

>>> # Event Detection (ED) Task
>>> results = infer(text=text, task="ED")
>>> print(results[0]["events"])
[
    { "type": "attack", "trigger": "assault", "offset": [113, 120]},
    { "type": "injure", "trigger": "pounded", "offset": [121, 128]}
]

>>> # Event Argument Extraction (EAE) Task
>>> results = infer(text=text, triggers=[("assault", 113, 120), ("pounded", 121, 128)], task="EAE")
>>> print(results[0]["events"])
[
    {
        "type": "attack", "trigger": "assault", "offset": [113, 120],
        "arguments": [
            {   "mention": "U.S.", "offset": [0, 4], "role": "attacker"},
            {   "mention": "British", "offset": [9, 16], "role": "attacker"},
            {   "mention": "Saturday", "offset": [81, 89], "role": "time"}
        ]
    },
    {
        "type": "injure", "trigger": "pounded", "offset": [121, 128],
        "arguments": [
            {   "mention": "U.S.", "offset": [0, 4], "role": "attacker"},
            {   "mention": "Saturday", "offset": [81, 89], "role": "time"},
            {   "mention": "British", "offset": [9, 16], "role": "attacker"}
        ]
    }
]
```

# Train your Own Model with OmniEvent
OmniEvent can help users easily train and evaluate their customized models on specific datasets.

We show a step-by-step example of using OmniEvent to train and evaluate an ***Event Detection*** model on ***ACE-EN*** dataset in the ***Seq2Seq*** paradigm.
More examples are shown in [examples](./examples).

## Step 1: Process the dataset into the unified format
We provide standard data processing scripts for several commonly-used datasets. Checkout the details in [scripts/data_processing](./scripts/data_processing).
```shell
dataset=ace2005-en  # the dataset name
cd scripts/data_processing/$dataset
bash run.sh
```

## Step 2: Set up the customized configurations
We keep track of the configurations of dataset, model and training parameters via a single `*.yaml` file. See [./configs](./configs) for details.

```python
>>> from OmniEvent.arguments import DataArguments, ModelArguments, TrainingArguments, ArgumentParser
>>> from OmniEvent.input_engineering.seq2seq_processor import type_start, type_end

>>> parser = ArgumentParser((ModelArguments, DataArguments, TrainingArguments))
>>> model_args, data_args, training_args = parser.parse_yaml_file(yaml_file="config/all-datasets/ed/s2s/ace-en.yaml")

>>> training_args.output_dir = 'output/ACE2005-EN/ED/seq2seq/t5-base/'
>>> data_args.markers = ["<event>", "</event>", type_start, type_end]
```

## Step 3: Initialize the model and tokenizer
OmniEvent supports various backbones. The users can specify the model and tokenizer in the config file and initialize them as follows.

```python
>>> from OmniEvent.backbone.backbone import get_backbone
>>> from OmniEvent.model.model import get_model

>>> backbone, tokenizer, config = get_backbone(model_type=model_args.model_type, 
                           		       model_name_or_path=model_args.model_name_or_path, 
                           		       tokenizer_name=model_args.model_name_or_path, 
                           		       markers=data_args.markers,
                           		       new_tokens=data_args.markers)
>>> model = get_model(model_args, backbone)
```

## Step 4: Initialize the dataset and evaluation metric
OmniEvent prepares the `DataProcessor` and the corresponding evaluation metrics for different task and paradigms.

***Note that** the metrics here are paradigm-dependent and are **not** used for the final unified evaluation.*

```python
>>> from OmniEvent.input_engineering.seq2seq_processor import EDSeq2SeqProcessor
>>> from OmniEvent.evaluation.metric import compute_seq_F1

>>> train_dataset = EDSeq2SeqProcessor(data_args, tokenizer, data_args.train_file)
>>> eval_dataset = EDSeq2SeqProcessor(data_args, tokenizer, data_args.validation_file)
>>> metric_fn = compute_seq_F1
```

## Step 5: Define Trainer and train
OmniEvent adopts [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer) from ü§ó [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) for training and evaluation.

```python
>>> from OmniEvent.trainer_seq2seq import Seq2SeqTrainer

>>> trainer = Seq2SeqTrainer(
        args=training_args,
        model=model,
        train_dataset=train_dataset,
        eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
        compute_metrics=metric_fn,
        data_collator=train_dataset.collate_fn,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
    )
>>> trainer.train()
```

## Step 6: Unified Evaluation
Since the metrics in Step 4 depend on the paradigm, it is not fair to directly compare the performance of models in different paradigms. 

OmniEvent evaluates models of different paradigms in a unified manner, where the predictions of different models are converted to predictions on the same candidate sets and then evaluated.

```python  
>>> from OmniEvent.evaluation.utils import predict, get_pred_s2s
>>> from OmniEvent.evaluation.convert_format import get_trigger_detection_s2s

>>> logits, labels, metrics, test_dataset = predict(trainer=trainer, tokenizer=tokenizer, data_class=EDSeq2SeqProcessor,
                                                    data_args=data_args, data_file=data_args.test_file,
                                                    training_args=training_args)
>>> # paradigm-dependent metrics
>>> print("{} test performance before converting: {}".formate(test_dataset.dataset_name, metrics["test_micro_f1"]))  
ACE2005-EN test performance before converting: 66.4215686224377

>>> preds = get_pred_s2s(logits, tokenizer)
>>> # convert to the unified prediction and evaluate
>>> pred_labels = get_trigger_detection_s2s(preds, labels, data_args.test_file, data_args, None)
ACE2005-EN test performance after converting: 67.41016109045849
```

For those datasets whose test set annotations are not public, such as MAVEN and LEVEN, OmniEvent provide scripts to generate submission files. See [dump_result.py](./OmniEvent/evaluation/dump_result.py) for details.

# Consistent Evaluation
OmniEvent provides corresponding remedies for the three discrepancies in event extraction evaluation, as suggested in our ACL 2023 [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.586.pdf). 
## 1. Consistent data preprocessing
We provide several preprocessing scripts in `scripts/data_processing`. For ACE 2005, we provide three mainstream scripts: `ace2005-dygie`, `ace2005-oneie`, and `ace2005-en`. Users can easily use the scripts to process the original data into a unified data format. 
## 2. Output Standardization
We implement the output standardization in `OmniEvent/evaluation/convert_format.py`. Specifically, users can use corresponding functions to convert the output of different paradigms into the output space of the token classification method.
## 3. Pipeline Evaluation
As suggested in `OmniEvent/evaluation/README.md`, we provide several evaluation modes for evaluating event argument extraction. We recommend the **strict** mode for comparable evaluation. And we provide a unified extracted trigger set for pipeline evaluation of different event argument extraction methods. The triggers are extracted by an advanced ED model: CLEVE. The extracted triggers for different datasets (ACE 2005, RichERE, and TACKBP 2014-2017) are placed in [here](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/799c8c7c44d24c1db2b7/?dl=1).


# Experiments
We implement and evaluate state-of-the-art methods on some popular benchmarks using OmniEvent, and the results are shown in our ACL 2023 paper "[The Devil is in the Details: On the Pitfalls of Event Extraction Evaluation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.586.pdf)".
