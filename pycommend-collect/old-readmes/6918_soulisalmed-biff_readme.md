## Recommendations for pdf highlighting on the reMarkable tablet	

  * On reMarkable, use the Highlighter. All the other tools will not (and should not) be detected by biff.
  * Make sure to cover all the text you want to extract. Partly covered text will not be extracted.
  * For figures, just draw a rectangle shape around it. The interior will be cropped and added as an image to the output odt.
  * Formulas will not be extracted as such, but you can export them as images (see example below).
  * The quality of the text extraction will depend on the pdf quality. Automatically generated pdf from scans will give poor results.
  * Export the PDF using the reMarkable USB web interface (for example).
