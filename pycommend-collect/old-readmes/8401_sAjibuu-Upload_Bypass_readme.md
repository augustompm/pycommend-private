# About

**Upload Bypass** is a simple tool designed to assist penetration testers and bug hunters in testing file upload mechanisms. It leverages various bug bounty techniques to simplify the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, ensuring thorough assessments of web applications.

### ðŸš€ Updates
- The code almost written from scratch, utilizes better file parsing and eliminates most of the bugs.
- Modular code! Now you can contribute to the code and add your own modules.
- Introducing 3 different modes, detection, exploitation and anti_malware check, choose your weapon!
- New state feature, you can now pause the code and resume from where you left off!
- New UI for an easy view.
- Docker file for an easy deployment.
- Various test files provided for internal testing.
- Debug mode. If you encounter a bug, you can save the stack trace and share it with me for further analysis.

### Attention
This tool is restricted in the OSCP exam!

# Features 
### Detection Mode:
   Suitable for real-world penetration tests. This mode will upload harmless files and will not attempt to exploit the target.

*New* - If a destination folder for the uploaded files is provided, the program will determine if the uploaded sample file is rendered.
For example, if you chose PHP, the program will try to determine if an echo command is executed and rendered successfully, if it does, it'll suggest to enter an interactive shell.

### Exploitation Mode:
   Suitable when you want to exploit the target and upload an interactive Web-shell (If a destination upload directory is provided), it will upload the file with a random UUID, so it will be harder for fuzzers to guess.    
### Anti-Malware mode:
   Suitable for an Anti-Malware presence test. Upload an Eicar(Anti-Malware test file) to the system, and if the user specifies the location of the uploaded file, the program will check if the file uploaded successfully and exists in the system in order to determine if an Anti-Malware is present on the system. 

# Customisation

###
Check out config.py in lib directory, you can add new extensions, mimetypes, magicbytes, configure the use of HTTP/HTTPs protocol and etc'...
###
To add a new module, simply add a function with your desired functionality to modules.py then add the function by name into the list "active_modules" in config.py
###
To add a new file extension, add a sample.{ext} file to assets/sample_files, then add the extension and its mimetype/magic bytes to config.py

# Download:
    git clone https://github.com/sAjibuu/Upload_Bypass.git

# Installation:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Installation from a Docker Hub
    sudo docker pull sajibuu/upload_bypass 

# Installation from a local docker file
    sudo docker build -t sajibuu/upload_bypass .

# Docker Usage examples
### Example without proxy:
    sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/request:/Upload_Bypass/{your_request_file} -it sajibuu/upload_bypass -r request -s 'file was uploaded successfully' -E php -e

### Example with proxy:
 **Make sure to listen to port 8080 on all interfaces!**

    sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/request:/Upload_Bypass/{your_request_file} -it sajibuu/upload_bypass -r request -s 'file was uploaded successfully' -E php -e -p http://{docker_interface_IP}:8080

# Limitations: 
  The tool will not function properly with the following:
  1. CAPTCHA implementation is in place.
  2. A requirement for a CSRF token for each request.
  3. A destination folder is provided for the uploaded files, but, the uploaded files are saved with a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) instead of their actual filenames, the program won't be able to enter interactive shell.

## Disclaimer

**Please note that the use of Upload Bypass and any actions taken with it are solely at your own risk. The tool is provided for educational and testing purposes only. The developer of Upload Bypass is not responsible for any misuse, damage, or illegal activities caused by its usage.**

# Usage:

## ***Attention***

The program only works with request files generated by proxy tools, such as Burp Suite and ZAP OWASP.

Before saving the request file from the proxy you are using, for example, Burp Suite, replace the the following parameter values with their coressponding markers:

**File content:** *\*data\**

Example: Replace the image binary data with the string *\*data\**

**Filename:** *\*filename\**

Example: Replace the filename including its extension with the string *\*filename\**

**Content-Type header:** *\*mimetype\**.

Example: Replace the file's content-type (mimetype) with the string *\*mimetype\**

### Example 1:

How it should look like in a JSON request:

### Example 2:

How it should look like in a multi-part data request:

# Examples
  ### Detection mode
     python upload_bypass.py -r test -s 'File uploaded successfully' -E php -D /uploads --burp --detect
  ### Exploitation mode
     python upload_bypass.py -r test -s 'File uploaded successfully' -E php -D /uploads --burp --exploit

# Issues
If you encounter an issue, please use the debug mode with a flag value of 2 and share it with me (the debug file is saved with the user supplied arguments, the provided request file, and the stack-trace error). If the file contains sensitive information, you can use flag value of 1, which only saves the stack-trace error to the file.
