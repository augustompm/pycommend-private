Here's a single, comprehensive section on cost comparison for your README:

## Cost Comparison and Value Proposition

Our solution offers an optimal balance of affordability, accuracy, and advanced features:

### Cost Breakdown
- Average token usage per image: ~1200
- Total tokens per page (including prompt): ~1500
- [GPT4O] Input token cost: $5 per million tokens
- [GPT4O] Output token cost: $15 per million tokens

For 1000 documents:
- Estimated total cost: $15

#### Cost Optimization Options
1. Utilizing GPT4 mini: Reduces cost to ~$8 per 1000 documents
2. Implementing batch API: Further reduces cost to ~$4 per 1000 documents

#### Market Comparison
This solution is significantly more affordable than alternatives:
- Our cost: $15 per 1000 documents
- CloudConvert: ~$30 per 1000 documents (PDFTron mode, 4 credits required)

While cost-effectiveness is a major advantage, our solution also provides:
- Superior accuracy and consistency
- Precise table generation
- Output in easily editable markdown format

This combination of affordability and advanced features makes solution stand out in the document processing market. It's not just about being cheaper; it's about providing excellent value through reliability, flexibility, and high-quality output.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) (optional but recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yigitkonur/llm-openai-ocr.git
   cd llm-openai-ocr
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_openai_endpoint
   OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_ID=your_openai_deployment_id
   OPENAI_API_VERSION=your_openai_api_version  # Default is "gpt-4o"
   BATCH_SIZE=10  # Optional: Default is 1
   MAX_CONCURRENT_OCR_REQUESTS=5  # Optional: Default is 5
   MAX_CONCURRENT_PDF_CONVERSION=4  # Optional: Default is 4
   ```

   > **Note:** Replace `your_openai_api_key`, `your_azure_openai_endpoint`, and `your_openai_deployment_id` with your actual OpenAI credentials.

5. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
