Active Development: [V2 App Branch](https://github.com/EyeTrackVR/EyeTrackVR/tree/v2.0-beta-feature-branch)

### [Documentation](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/)

# EyeTrackVR

Source First and *affordable* VR eye tracker platform for [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/) via `OSC` and `UDP` protocol.

> **Note**: This project is in development and is not fully finished



## Documentation
Please check out our [documentation site.](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/)



## Hardware

3d files for mounting brackets can be found [here](https://github.com/RedHawk989/EyeTrackVR-Hardware)
IR emitter PCB files are also located there, along with pre-soldered PCBs on the [official store](https://store.eyetrackvr.dev/). For more info, please reference our [documentation site](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/how_to_build/parts_list)



## ESP32 Cam Firmware

Current work has been with our official firmware by `lorow` and `ZanzyTHEbar`, found [here](https://github.com/EyeTrackVR/OpenIris).


## Headset support

Pretty much any headset that can fit the camera and LEDs can be supported. However, mounts may not have been made for it. Please reference our [parts list](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/how_to_build/parts_list#_3d-printed-mounts) for linked mounts and [create your own mount page](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/how_to_build/creating_your_own_mount) for details.


## About IR Emitter Safety

Please *exercise extreme caution* when messing around with IR emitters.
<ins>Once safety testing has been completed links and files will be provided for the emitters</ins>. Please make sure you know what you are doing when assembling the IR emitters.
 <ins>**DO NOT BYPASS (OR NOT DO) ANY SAFETY FEATURES PUT IN PLACE**</ins>. This can result in irreversible bodily harm.
The safety measures were put in place to REDUCE the potential failure risk. All further safety responsibilities are on the user.
This includes visually checking with an IR camera that the brightness is correct and making sure you do not feel warmth.

> **Warning**: Make sure you are using **NON-focused** emitters and at power less than ***5mW cm^2 total per eye***.
Please read our LED safety page for a breakdown of math for our V3 and V4 LED kits [here](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/getting_started/led_safety)
