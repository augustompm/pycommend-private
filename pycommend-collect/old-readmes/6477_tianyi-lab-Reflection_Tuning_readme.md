## Overview

### Reflection-Tuning (V1)
We propose a reflection-based method for improving the quality of instruction-response pairs. 
Given the initial base dataset, we are motivated to generate a high-quality version of each data point with an oracle model, chatGPT for instance. 
However, a common problem with using LLMs as judges is the failure to obtain diverse results. 
To overcome this potential problem, inspired by Chain-of-Thought prompting, we further define several specific criteria for the oracle model to follow, and respond to those specific criteria with critical responses, respectively. 
Then the responses to these criteria can serve as bridges (chain of thought) to generate new instruction-response pairs that are satisfied. 

### Selective Reflection-Tuning (V2)

In the original Reflection-Tuning, we propose a data improvement method through Reflection. 
However, two research questions arise: <br>
1. Is the teacher-refined data compatible with the needs of the student model?
2. How does the student model decide which enhanced data are most needed and critical to its training?

To answer the above questions, we propose Selective Reflection-Tuning, in which the student model can decide whether to accept the improvement of the teacher model. 


## Highlights

### Reflection-Tuning (V1)
* In Reflection-Tuning V1, we propose a reflection method that can improve the quality of the instruction-tuning dataset, which is a general method and can be utilized on almost ANY instruction-tuning dataset.
* We implement our method on both [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) and [WizardLM](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM) datasets and release the newly-generated high-quality recycled datasets.

### Selective Reflection-Tuning (V2)
* We propose an interactive selection pipeline where the oracle model and student model cooperate to build a more coherent and model-compatible instruction-following dataset, which can be further adapted into other self-improvement scenarios.
* Our selectively recycled data has a supreme quality, with only instruction tuning on a few thousand of automatically generated data, our models achieve promising performances compared to models with dozens of thousands of data.
* We present a nuanced evaluation schema r-IFD that quantifies the efficacy and relevance of instruction-response pairs.

## Selective Reflection-Tuning

### Introduction

Existing methods of data enhancement usually do not take a critical criterion into account: **Is the teacher-refined data compatible with the needs of the student model?** These approaches typically do not account for the inherent randomness and potential degradation associated with the generative models' output, leading to an oversight in how the student model responds to these "improved" data samples. Consequently, a mechanism for the student model to selectively integrate these enhancements has been notably absent. To bridge this gap, our work introduces an interactive pipeline wherein an oracle generative model engages in a reflection process to enhance both the instruction and response of a data sample. The student model then evaluates whether to incorporate these improvements based on its unique attributes. This pipeline is versatile and can be adapted to various contexts where data enhancement is needed.

Then, another pivotal question arises: **How does the student model decide which enhanced data are most needed and critical to its training?** This question underpins the challenge of autonomously evaluating the quality of instructions and responses. Common practices involve utilizing sophisticated models like GPT-4 for assessment purposes or employing a secondary judge model equipped with evaluative capabilities. These methods, however, present limitations: they fail to address the discrepancies between the evaluating model and the actual student model undergoing training. Particularly in the latter approach, even though the judge model and the student model share the same structural framework, their weight distributions diverge once endowed with basic evaluative functions. Consequently, the preferences of the judge model may not align with the real student model's requirements. To circumvent these issues, we adopt a statistical method, utilizing the Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD) score proposed by [Cherry LLM](https://github.com/MingLiiii/Cherry_LLM). This score is derived directly from the raw student model, thereby mitigating potential domain shifts and ensuring that the evaluation is better aligned with the student model’s learning context. We further introduce a reversed version of IFD named reversed-IFD (r-IFD). This metric evaluates how much the response contributes to predicting the corresponding instruction.

### Method

<a ><img src="images/reflection_main.png" alt="overview" style="width: 80%; min-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>
</p>

We utilize the IFD score to select reflected instructions and utilize the r-IFD score to select reflected responses. 

### Results

Below is the performance for pair-wise comparison between our model and other classic models on the WizardLM test set. We follow the implementation from [AlpaGasus](https://github.com/Lichang-Chen/AlpaGasus) and [Cherry LLM](https://github.com/MingLiiii/Cherry_LLM), which greatly eliminates the potential position bias of GPT4. The prompts can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11716), and the data, code, and use cases for evaluation can be found in [Cherry LLM Repo](https://github.com/MingLiiii/Cherry_LLM?tab=readme-ov-file#evaluation).

Below are the performance results on the Alapca Eval leaderboard. “Data” represents the number of data used for fine-tuning. “RLHF/AIF” represents whether the model utilizes an additional RLHF or RLAIF process.

Below are comparisons between model performances and data used for fine-tuning on the Alapca Eval benchmark and the open LLM leaderboard. We utilize star markers to represent our models, dot markers to represent other instruction-tuned models and triangle markers to represent RLHF/AIF models. Blue markers represent 7B models, red markers represent 13B models and purple markers represent models with larger weights.

**It is astonishing that with less than 1k automatically generated instruction samples (2%, 926 samples), our model achieves really promising performance (74.29 win rate on alpaca eval rate, 57.80 averaged score on Open LLM Leaderboard), showing the supreme quality of our sRecycled data.**

## Install

Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Code for Reflection
#### Note: 
Reflecting on the whole dataset containing dozens of thousands of data will consume a lot, so we recommend using some tiny datasets for the beginning, for example, cherry data from [Cherry LLM](https://github.com/MingLiiii/Cherry_LLM). Experiments show that simply reflecting on a subset of high-quality data can also get a promising performance. <br>
In the below scripts, we directly run on ```data/cherry_alpaca_v1/cherry_alpaca_5_percent_compressed.json``` which contains only approximately 3k [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) data. 

### Reflection on Instruction


1. Reflection
```
python reflection_code/reflecn_instruction.py \
    --data_path data/cherry_alpaca_v1/cherry_alpaca_5_percent_compressed.json \
    --save_path cherry_alpaca_5_percent_reflect_ins_raw.json \
    --api_key xxx 
```
```--data_path```: The targeted dataset in the Alpaca format <br>
```--save_path```: The path to save the raw reflection texts <br>
```--api_key```: Your openAI key

2. Extract the instruction-response pairs:
```
python reflection_code/reflect_instruction_postprocess.py \
    --raw_data_path cherry_alpaca_5_percent_reflect_ins_raw.json \
    --ori_data_path data/cherry_alpaca_v1/cherry_alpaca_5_percent_compressed.json \
    --save_path cherry_alpaca_5_percent_reflect_ins.json \
    --save_intermediate_path cherry_alpaca_5_percent_reflect_ins_mid.json \
    --api_key xxx 
```
```--raw_data_path```: The path that saves the raw reflection texts <br>
```--ori_data_path```: The original targeted dataset in the Alpaca format <br>
```--save_path```: The path to save formated dataset in the Alpaca format <br>
```--save_intermediate_path```: The path to save the middle results <br>
```--api_key```: Your openAI key

### Reflection on Response
1. Reflection
```
python reflection_code/reflect_response.py \
    --data_path data/cherry_alpaca_v1/cherry_alpaca_5_percent_compressed.json \
    --save_path cherry_alpaca_5_percent_reflect_res_raw.json \
    --api_key xxx 
```

2. Extract the instruction-response pairs:
```
python reflection_code/reflect_response_postprocess.py \
    --raw_data_path cherry_alpaca_5_percent_reflect_res_raw.json \
    --ori_data_path data/cherry_alpaca_v1/cherry_alpaca_5_percent_compressed.json \
    --save_path cherry_alpaca_5_percent_reflect_res.json \
    --save_intermediate_path cherry_alpaca_5_percent_reflect_res_mid.json \
    --api_key xxx 
```

Note: When reflecting on the instruction, we first compress the instruction and input it into one single instruction for easier processing by using chatGPT. 
The whole compressed Alpaca data can be found in the data folder. <br>
Note: The extraction of reflection results is based on regular expression and, thus is not perfect. We will release the raw output before the extraction in the future. 

## Code for Selection

1. Generate Data Statistics
```
python selection_code/data_analysis.py \
    --data_path data/cherry_alpaca_v1/cherry_alpaca_5_percent_compressed.json \
    --save_path cherry_alpaca_5_percent_analysis.jsonl \
    --model_name_or_path meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf 
```
This code calculates the necessary statistics for calculating IFD scores and r-IFD scores. <br>
Please feel free to customize your own training prompt and model. 

2. Put the Statistics to Original Data
```
python selection_code/put_analysis_to_data.py \
    --pt_data_path cherry_alpaca_5_percent_analysis.jsonl \
    --json_data_path data/cherry_alpaca_v1/cherry_alpaca_5_percent_compressed.json \
    --json_save_path cherry_alpaca_5_percent_with_analysis.json 
```
After obtaining data with IFD scores and r-IFD scores, you can compare these scores to make the customized selection.
