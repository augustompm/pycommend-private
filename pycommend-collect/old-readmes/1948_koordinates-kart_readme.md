#### Quick Start

1. Export a GeoPackage from [Koordinates](https://koordinates.com/) with any combination of vector layers and tables.
2. Create a new Kart repository and import the GeoPackage (eg. `kx-foo-layer.gpkg`).
   ```console
   $ kart init myproject --import GPKG:kx-foo-layer.gpkg
   $ cd myproject
   ```
   Use this repository as the directory to run all the other commands in.
   This will also create a working copy as `myproject/myproject.gpkg` to edit.
3. Editing the working copy in QGIS/etc:
   - will track changes in the internal `kart` tables
   - additions/edits/deletes of features are supported
   - changing feature PKs is supported
   - schema changes should be detected, but aren't supported yet (will error).
   - Use F5 to refresh your QGIS map after changing the underlying working-copy data using `kart`.
4. With your working copy, `kart` commands should work if run from the `myproject/` folder. Check `--help` for options, the most important ones are supported. In some cases options are passed straight through to an underlying git command:
   - `kart diff` diff the working copy against the repository (no index!)
   - `kart commit -m {message}` commit outstanding changes from the working copy
   - `kart log` review commit history
   - `kart branch` & `kart checkout -b` branch management
   - `kart fetch` fetch upstream changes.
   - `kart status` show working copy state.
   - `kart merge` merge. Supports `--ff`/`--no-ff`/`--ff-only` from one merge source.
   - `kart switch` switch to existing or new branches.
   - `kart reset` & `kart restore` discard changes in the working copy.
   - `kart tag ...`
   - `kart remote ...`. Remember simple remotes can just be another local directory.
   - `kart push` / `kart pull`
   - `kart clone` initialise a new repository from a remote URL,
