**LoG** utilizes a single RTX 4090 for training highly realistic urban-scale models and for their real-time rendering. Visit our [**project page**](https://zju3dv.github.io/LoG_webpage/) for more demos.

Our code is built upon PyTorch and leverages [gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/diff-gaussian-rasterization) techniques. 

## Quick Start

For a smooth setup, follow the [installation guide](./docs/install.md).

## Dataset Preparation

We employ [Colmap](https://colmap.github.io/) to prepare the dataset. Refer to the [preprocessing documentation](./docs/preprocess.md) for detailed instructions. A minimal example dataset is provided [here](https://forms.gle/E3Roi9zriu6Sk4557).

## Training

Training the model is as simple as one command:

```bash
python3 apps/train.py --cfg config/example/test/train.yml split train
```

We automatically configure heuristic parameters based on the dataset size.

We provide a path for interpolation visualization

```bash
python3 apps/train.py --cfg config/example/test/train.yml split demo_interpolate ckptname output/example/test/level_of_gaussian/model_init.pth
```

The visualization video will be stored at `output/example/test/level_of_gaussian/demo_interpolate/rgb.mp4`

## Immersive Visualization :rocket:

We will update a real-time rendering tool designed for immersive visualization.
