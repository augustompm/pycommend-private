# üìå NOTE
For locating a phone number and getting the exact location, it is not exacly possible to get the exact location from a phone number, The Opencage module that serves to get location from a number doesnt exactly get the location per say 
<br>
<b>Here is what is actually happening:</b>

The phone number is entered and a library is used to turn the country calling code into the name of the country. For example numbers starting with +91 becomes India, +880 is Bangladesh, +34 is Spain, etc.

The country name is then sent to openCage geocoding API as a forward geocoding request (placename to coordinates). We then return the coordinates of the center of the country. For example we turn India into 22.3511148, 78.6677428, roughly in the middle of Uttar Pradesh.

People get confused and angry as to why the coordinates are not actually where the phone is physically located.

Unfortunately there is no such thing as magic, and neither we, nor anyone else, have the ability to derive a phone‚Äôs location from an input string like India or Spain.

If you want to know the location of a phone you need a service (application) running on the phone that has user permission to access the location from the operating system. How accurate the coordinates reported by the phone are will depend on which technology is used to determine the location (GPS, cell triangulation, wifi, etc). Once you have those coordinates you can then send them to opencage API as a reverse geocoding request. More info at https://opencagedata.com


# Faqs
## If your getting the error below which says 
 1) sudo xosint
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/bin/xosint", line 11, in
from googlesearch import search
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'googlesearch'
  

<u>Solution: </u> Kindly make sure you ran the `bash setup.sh` file and make sure you don't interrupt the setup process and after you run that, and doesnt still work type `pip install google` and re run xosint.
  if your still having issue with it run `pip install googlesearch-python` and run xosint. That should solve your problem with xosint. Thank you and share to friends.
<br>

2) Having an npm error when installing eslint?<br>
<u>Solution: </u>Type <code>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash </code>
Then type <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> OR <code></code>source ~/.zshrc</code>
<br>
Then type <code>nvm install node</code><br><code>nvm use node</code><br><code>nvm alais default node</code><br><code>npm cache clean --force</code><br>
Then install eslint again: <code>npm install -g eslint</code>
